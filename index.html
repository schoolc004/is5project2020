		Parking space is one of the important to the drivers to park their car in the available slot area. It is a location that is designated for parking a car. A parking lot information storage means for storing a parking lot information database. This system will implement in Iloilo Science and Technology University (ISAT U). As the number of cars increase in an area the demand for available parking areas in a location also increases. In everyday life of an employee immediately finding an available parking is equivalent of being late or being on time. 
The problem with this system is that if the drivers want to park their car in a parking lot they canâ€™t park immediately. Most of the drivers are encounter many problems while parking a car in a huge car park inside the school campus. For instance, in a crowded huge multi-storey car park, it is difficult for a driver to remember were his/her car is parked. It is also difficult for a driver to locate an empty parking space to park his/her car in a huge car park, despite being informed that numerous parking space are available parking spaces. So, it would be a great help if there is a device that has a system that could assist the driver to find a parking space.
In this study, the researchers will develop a system that will help people to park their car in the available area. The invention provides a parking area for a car, a device will detect for a car if there is an available space. If a car is in the slotted parking area, the sensor information is translated to parking space counts. If a car is in the unslotted parking area, the sensor information is translated to a parking space map. The monitor will show the necessary information to the driver. If theres an available space parking area it will show on the monitor a green light. If there no space available, the red light on the monitor will automatically appeared.
